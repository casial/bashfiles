If you're reading this, I'll bet you can guess what these files are.

Highlights:

* Looks for existing screen sessions on login and allows you to attach to any of them
* git stuff in prompt only happens when you're in a "registered" git repo
* 256color optimized
* auto-loads local mods (needs work)
* prompt gracefully degrades on non-Linux (well it used to... untested)
* Pathogen-ized prompt (use a Pathogen-modified font)
* prompt tells you what screen window you're in if you are
* prompt tells you if you're in tmux (window info not available)
* prompt tells you if you're in a writable directory
* prompt indicates if ssh-agent is available to this shell
* prompt changes color when root
* su'ing to root maintains history and $HOME etc.
* screen windows are automatically named the short-hostname
* complete-able rc control aliases (start, stop, etc) with Lin/Sol/HP-UX support
